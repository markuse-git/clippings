Enables you to keep track of your clients clippings and generates reports

== Description ==

On the frontend it provides a form to enter your clients clippings to the database. By using the clippings
search your can search for clippings by client, publication or date. 

The Submitted Material search lets you find material that has not yet been published in the country you
searched for or, if you searched by client, in every country monitored. This way you'll know
immediately which material you can offer for publication in which country. 

You can also create reports using the form opened when clicking on the 'Create Report' button. The report will give
you a list of clippings published in the monitored period. It will also give you a matrix in which these
clippings are distributed by their kind and the tier of the publication in which they are published. 

Finally, it gives you a total score which is calculated by multiplying the amount of clippings with the evaluation
of their kind you defined on the options page as well as with the evaluation of the publication in which they
are published and which you defined by the according category in the publications posts. 

This enables you to compare the results of two periods and thus outline an evolution of your work over time.
